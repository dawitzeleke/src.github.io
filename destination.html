        With the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other African country
        (including Egypt), Ethiopia is a hidden gem that is overlooked by many
        travellers. <br />
        In this section, we will tell you the most famous tourist attractions in
        Ethiopia. Even though there is a lot of places that you can visit here,
        we have pulled together what we think are the best places to visit in
        Ethiopia. So, let us jump into it.

              Ethiopia's capital is located more or less in the dead centre of the
              country and is the world's third-highest capital at 2,400 m. Its name
              means 'New Flower' and it is a relatively modern city, founded in 1887
              by Emperor Menelik II. In just over a century it has grown from
              nothing into a modern metropolis of several million people. Its
              altitude lends it a comfortable climate and throughout the year the
              weather is temperate with just the occasional downpour.

              With stunning views in all directions, the town of Arba Minch is
              situated in a truly spectacular location. It lies at an elevation
              of 1,300m in the foothills of the Rift Valley and mountains rise
              up to almost 4,000m to the west. The town comprises 2 separate
              settlements, Sikela and Shecha that are 4 km apart and connected
              by a sealed road, so although the total population is around the
              75,000 marks it still retains a small-town atmosphere.

                This scenic national park is situated in the dry acacia savanna of the
                Rift Valley some 200km from Addis Ababa. A magnificent 150m-deep
                gorge, carved by the Awash River, forms the southern boundary of the
                park, including a substantial waterfall. To the north, you'll see the
                ragged edges of Mount Fantelle, a dormant volcano whose crater towers
                above the surrounding bush. Other highlights include the Filwoha Hot
                Springs, which feed a series of beautiful translucent blue pools and
                Lake Beseka.

            This fascinating town was the centre of the Axumite Empire, one of the
            most important and technologically advanced civilisations of its time
            and a major force in world trade between the 1st and 7th centuries
            AD. <br />
            A further twist in the town's long history is speculation that it
            could have held the court of the Queen of Sheba and also that it is
            the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. Whatever the truth
            of these matters it is undoubtedly the holiest city of the Ethiopian
            Orthodox church and there is a startling wealth of antiquities both to
            be seen and as yet still undiscovered.

            The isolated town of Lalibela, situated high up in the Lasta
            Mountains, is famous throughout the world for its incredible rock-hewn
            churches. At 2,630 m and perched among wild mountains, the setting is
            fantastic. <br />
            From the 10th to the mid-13th century it was the capital of the Zagwe
            Dynasty that ruled the country and it was under the direction of its
            most famous King, Lalibela, that the churches were carved. He gathered
            together the greatest craftsmen possible and some estimates think as
            many as 40,000 people were required to create the churches.

            Of all the Rift Valley lakes, Lake Langano is the most developed for
            tourism, lying adjacent to the Abiata-Shals National Park that is
            dominated by the two lakes for which it is named. Lake Langano is 18
            km long and 16 km wide and its soft brown waters are set against the
            blue backdrop of the Arsi Mountains, which soar to 4000 m. Although
            the area around the lake is largely deforested, a variety of wildlife
            live here including hippos, monkeys, baboons, warthogs, and a huge
            variety of birds.
